Deployment
==========

Deploy your fine-tuned models to production endpoints using ModelBuilder and Bedrock integration for scalable inference.

**What you'll accomplish:**
- Deploy models to real-time endpoints with auto-scaling
- Set up Bedrock model deployment workflows
- Configure monitoring and A/B testing

**Prerequisites:** Fine-tuned model or training job, SageMaker endpoint permissions, understanding of traffic patterns

**Choose your approach:** ModelBuilder for SageMaker endpoints, Bedrock ModelBuilder for managed inference.
