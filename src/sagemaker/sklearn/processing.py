        The SKLearnProcessor handles Amazon SageMaker processing tasks for jobs using scikit-learn.

        Args:
            framework_version (str): The version of scikit-learn.
            role (str): An AWS IAM role name or ARN. The Amazon SageMaker training jobs
                and APIs that create Amazon SageMaker endpoints use this role
                to access training data and model artifacts. After the endpoint
                is created, the inference code might use the IAM role, if it
                needs to access an AWS resource.
            instance_type (str): Type of EC2 instance to use for
                processing, for example, 'ml.c4.xlarge'.
            instance_count (int): The number of instances to run
                the Processing job with. Defaults to 1.
            command ([str]): The command to run, along with any command-line flags.
                Example: ["python3", "-v"]. If not provided, ["python3"] or ["python2"]
                will be chosen based on the py_version parameter.
            volume_size_in_gb (int): Size in GB of the EBS volume to
                use for storing data during processing (default: 30).
            volume_kms_key (str): A KMS key for the processing
                volume.
            output_kms_key (str): The KMS key id for all ProcessingOutputs.
            max_runtime_in_seconds (int): Timeout in seconds.
                After this amount of time Amazon SageMaker terminates the job
                regardless of its current status.
            base_job_name (str): Prefix for processing name. If not specified,
                the processor generates a default job name, based on the
                training image name and current timestamp.
            sagemaker_session (sagemaker.session.Session): Session object which
                manages interactions with Amazon SageMaker APIs and any other
                AWS services needed. If not specified, the processor creates one
                using the default AWS configuration chain.
            env (dict): Environment variables to be passed to the processing job.
            tags ([dict]): List of tags to be passed to the processing job.
            network_config (sagemaker.network.NetworkConfig): A NetworkConfig
                object that configures network isolation, encryption of
                inter-container traffic, security group IDs, and subnets.
