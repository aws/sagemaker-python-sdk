        """Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is :class:`Estimator` used for unsupervised learning.

        Amazon SageMaker Latent Dirichlet Allocation is an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to describe
        a set of observations as a mixture of distinct categories. LDA is most commonly used to discover
        a user-specified number of topics shared by documents within a text corpus.
        Here each observation is a document, the features are the presence (or occurrence count) of each word, and
        the categories are the topics.

        This Estimator may be fit via calls to
        :meth:`~sagemaker.amazon.amazon_estimator.AmazonAlgorithmEstimatorBase.fit`. It requires Amazon
        :class:`~sagemaker.amazon.record_pb2.Record` protobuf serialized data to be stored in S3.
        There is an utility :meth:`~sagemaker.amazon.amazon_estimator.AmazonAlgorithmEstimatorBase.record_set` that
        can be used to upload data to S3 and creates :class:`~sagemaker.amazon.amazon_estimator.RecordSet` to be passed
        to the `fit` call.

        To learn more about the Amazon protobuf Record class and how to prepare bulk data in this format, please
        consult AWS technical documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/cdf-training.html

        After this Estimator is fit, model data is stored in S3. The model may be deployed to an Amazon SageMaker
        Endpoint by invoking :meth:`~sagemaker.amazon.estimator.EstimatorBase.deploy`. As well as deploying an Endpoint,
        deploy returns a :class:`~sagemaker.amazon.lda.LDAPredictor` object that can be used
        for inference calls using the trained model hosted in the SageMaker Endpoint.

        LDA Estimators can be configured by setting hyperparameters. The available hyperparameters for
        LDA are documented below.

        For further information on the AWS LDA algorithm,
        please consult AWS technical documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/lda.html

        Args:
            role (str): An AWS IAM role (either name or full ARN). The Amazon SageMaker training jobs and
                APIs that create Amazon SageMaker endpoints use this role to access
                training data and model artifacts. After the endpoint is created,
                the inference code might use the IAM role, if accessing AWS resource.
            train_instance_type (str): Type of EC2 instance to use for training, for example, 'ml.c4.xlarge'.
            num_topics (int): The number of topics for LDA to find within the data.
            alpha0 (float): Optional. Initial guess for the concentration parameter
            max_restarts (int): Optional. The number of restarts to perform during the Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
                spectral decomposition phase of the algorithm.
            max_iterations (int): Optional. The maximum number of iterations to perform during the
                ALS phase of the algorithm.
            tol (float): Optional. Target error tolerance for the ALS phase of the algorithm.
