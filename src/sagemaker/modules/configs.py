    The Compute class is a subclass of ``sagemaker_core.shapes.ResourceConfig``
    and allows the user to specify the compute resources for the training job.

    Parameters:
        instance_type (Optional[str]):
            The ML compute instance type. For information about available instance types,
            see https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/.
        instance_count (Optional[int]): The number of ML compute instances to use. For distributed
            training, provide a value greater than 1.
        volume_size_in_gb (Optional[int]):
            The size of the ML storage volume that you want to provision.  ML storage volumes store
            model artifacts and incremental states. Training algorithms might also use the ML
            storage volume for scratch space. Default: 30
        volume_kms_key_id (Optional[str]):
            The Amazon Web Services KMS key that SageMaker uses to encrypt data on the storage
            volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that run the training job.
        keep_alive_period_in_seconds (Optional[int]):
            The duration of time in seconds to retain configured resources in a warm pool for
            subsequent training jobs.
        instance_groups (Optional[List[InstanceGroup]]):
            A list of instance groups for heterogeneous clusters to be used in the training job.
        enable_managed_spot_training (Optional[bool]):
            To train models using managed spot training, choose True. Managed spot training
            provides a fully managed and scalable infrastructure for training machine learning
            models. this option is useful when training jobs can be interrupted and when there
            is flexibility when the training job is run.

    The Networking class is a subclass of ``sagemaker_core.shapes.VpcConfig`` and
    allows the user to specify the networking configuration for the training job.

    Parameters:
        security_group_ids (Optional[List[str]]):
            The VPC security group IDs, in the form sg-xxxxxxxx. Specify the
            security groups for the VPC that is specified in the Subnets field.
        subnets (Optional[List[str]]):
            The ID of the subnets in the VPC to which you want to connect your
            training job or model.
        enable_network_isolation (Optional[bool]):
            Isolates the training container. No inbound or outbound network calls can be made,
            except for calls between peers within a training cluster for distributed training.
            If you enable network isolation for training jobs that are configured to use a VPC,
            SageMaker downloads and uploads customer data and model artifacts through the
            specified VPC, but the training container does not have network access.
        enable_inter_container_traffic_encryption (Optional[bool]):
            To encrypt all communications between ML compute instances in distributed training
            choose True. Encryption provides greater security for distributed training, but
            training might take longer. How long it takes depends on the amount of
            communication between compute instances, especially if you use a deep learning
            algorithm in distributed training.
