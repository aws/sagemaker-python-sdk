        This ``Estimator`` executes an MXNet script in a managed MXNet execution environment, within a SageMaker
        Training Job. The managed MXNet environment is an Amazon-built Docker container that executes functions
        defined in the supplied ``entry_point`` Python script.

        Training is started by calling :meth:`~sagemaker.amazon.estimator.Framework.fit` on this Estimator.
        After training is complete, calling :meth:`~sagemaker.amazon.estimator.Framework.deploy` creates a
        hosted SageMaker endpoint and returns an :class:`~sagemaker.amazon.mxnet.model.MXNetPredictor` instance
        that can be used to perform inference against the hosted model.

        Technical documentation on preparing MXNet scripts for SageMaker training and using the MXNet Estimator is
        avaialble on the project home-page: https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk

            entry_point (str): Path (absolute or relative) to the Python source file which should be executed
                as the entry point to training. This should be compatible with either Python 2.7 or Python 3.5.
            source_dir (str): Path (absolute or relative) to a directory with any other training
                source code dependencies aside from tne entry point file (default: None). Structure within this
                directory are preserved when training on Amazon SageMaker.
            hyperparameters (dict): Hyperparameters that will be used for training (default: None).
                The hyperparameters are made accessible as a dict[str, str] to the training code on SageMaker.
                For convenience, this accepts other types for keys and values, but ``str()`` will be called
                to convert them before training.
            py_version (str): Python version you want to use for executing your model training code (default: 'py2').
                              One of 'py2' or 'py3'.
