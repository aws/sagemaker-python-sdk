        region (str): Region for which to retrieve default hyperparameters. (Default: None).
        model_id (str): Model ID of the model for which to
            retrieve the default hyperparameters. (Default: None).

            should be returned as well. Container hyperparameters are not used to tune
            the specific algorithm, but rather by SageMaker Training to setup
            the training container environment. For example, there is a container hyperparameter
            that indicates the entrypoint script to use. These hyperparameters may be required
            when creating a training job with boto3, however the ``Estimator`` classes
            should take care of adding container hyperparameters to the job. (Default: False).

        ValueError: If the combination of arguments specified is not supported.
