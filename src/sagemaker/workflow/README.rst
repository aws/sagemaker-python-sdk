SageMaker Workflow in Apache Airflow
====================================

Apache Airflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Apache Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org/index.html>`_
is a platform that enables you to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. Using Airflow,
you can build a workflow for SageMaker training, hyperparameter tuning, batch transform and endpoint deployment.
You can use any SageMaker deep learning framework or Amazon algorithms to perform above operations in Airflow.

For information about using SageMaker Workflow, see https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_workflow.html.
