SageMaker Python SDK is an open source library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker.

With the SDK, you can train and deploy models using popular deep learning frameworks **Apache MXNet** and **TensorFlow**.
You can also train and deploy models with **Amazon algorithms**,
which are scalable implementations of core machine learning algorithms that are optimized for SageMaker and GPU training.
If you have **your own algorithms** built into SageMaker compatible Docker containers, you can train and host models using these as well.

For detailed API reference please go to: `Read the Docs <https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io>`_

Installing the SageMaker Python SDK
-----------------------------------

The SageMaker Python SDK is built to PyPI and can be installed with pip as follows:

::

    pip install sagemaker

You can install from source by cloning this repository and running a pip install command in the root directory of the repository:

::

    git clone https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk.git
    cd sagemaker-python-sdk
    pip install .

Supported Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SageMaker Python SDK supports Unix/Linux and Mac.

Supported Python Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SageMaker Python SDK is tested on:

- Python 2.7
- Python 3.6

AWS Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a managed service, Amazon SageMaker performs operations on your behalf on the AWS hardware that is managed by Amazon SageMaker.
Amazon SageMaker can perform only operations that the user permits.
You can read more about which permissions are necessary in the `AWS Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html>`__.

The SageMaker Python SDK should not require any additional permissions.
However, if you are using an IAM role with a path in it, you should grant permission for ``iam:GetRole``.

Licensing
~~~~~~~~~
SageMaker Python SDK is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. It is copyright 2018 Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates. All Rights Reserved. The license is available at:
http://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SageMaker Python SDK has unit tests and integration tests.

You can install the libraries needed to run the tests by running :code:`pip install --upgrade .[test]` or, for Zsh users: :code:`pip install --upgrade .\[test\]`

**Unit tests**


We run unit tests with tox, which is a program that lets you run unit tests for multiple Python versions, and also make sure the
code fits our style guidelines. We run tox with Python 2.7 and 3.6, so to run unit tests
with the same configuration we do, you'll need to have interpreters for Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 installed.

To run the unit tests with tox, run:

::

    tox tests/unit

**Integrations tests**

To run the integration tests, the following prerequisites must be met

1. AWS account credentials are available in the environment for the boto3 client to use.
2. The AWS account has an IAM role named :code:`SageMakerRole` with the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy attached.

We recommend selectively running just those integration tests you'd like to run. You can filter by individual test function names with:

::

    pytest -k 'test_i_care_about'


You can also run all of the integration tests by running the following command, which runs them in sequence, which may take a while:

::

    pytest tests/integ


You can also run them in parallel:

::

    pytest -n auto tests/integ


Building Sphinx docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``cd`` into the ``doc`` directory and run:

::

    make html

You can edit the templates for any of the pages in the docs by editing the .rst files in the "doc" directory and then running "``make html``" again.

SageMaker SparkML Serving
-------------------------

With SageMaker SparkML Serving, you can now perform predictions against a SparkML Model in SageMaker.
In order to host a SparkML model in SageMaker, it should be serialized with ``MLeap`` library.

For more information on MLeap, see https://github.com/combust/mleap .

Supported major version of Spark: 2.2 (MLeap version - 0.9.6)

Here is an example on how to create an instance of  ``SparkMLModel`` class and use ``deploy()`` method to create an
endpoint which can be used to perform prediction against your trained SparkML Model.

.. code:: python

    sparkml_model = SparkMLModel(model_data='s3://path/to/model.tar.gz', env={'SAGEMAKER_SPARKML_SCHEMA': schema})
    model_name = 'sparkml-model'
    endpoint_name = 'sparkml-endpoint'
    predictor = sparkml_model.deploy(initial_instance_count=1, instance_type='ml.c4.xlarge', endpoint_name=endpoint_name)

Once the model is deployed, we can invoke the endpoint with a ``CSV`` payload like this:

.. code:: python

    payload = 'field_1,field_2,field_3,field_4,field_5'
    predictor.predict(payload)


For more information about the different ``content-type`` and ``Accept`` formats as well as the structure of the
``schema`` that SageMaker SparkML Serving recognizes, please see `SageMaker SparkML Serving Container`_.
