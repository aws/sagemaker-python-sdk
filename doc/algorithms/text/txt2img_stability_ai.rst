Text to Image - Stability AI
##################################

This is a text to image algorithm which supports many pre-trained models available in Stability AI Hub. The following
`sample notebook <https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_text_classification/Amazon_JumpStart_Text_Classification.ipynb>`__
demonstrates how to use the Sagemaker Python SDK for Text Classification for using these algorithms.

For detailed documentation please refer :ref:`Use Built-in Algorithms with Pre-trained Models in SageMaker Python SDK <built-in-algos>`
