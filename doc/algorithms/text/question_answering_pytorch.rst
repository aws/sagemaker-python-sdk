Question Answering - PyTorch
#####################################

This is a supervised question answering algorithm which supports fine-tuning of many pre-trained models available in Hugging Face. The following
`sample notebook <https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_question_answering/Amazon_JumpStart_Question_Answering.ipynb>`__
demonstrates how to use the Sagemaker Python SDK for Question Answering for using these algorithms.
