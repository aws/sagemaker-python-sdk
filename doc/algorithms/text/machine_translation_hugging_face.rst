Machine Translation - HuggingFace
#####################################


This is a supervised machine translation algorithm which supports many pre-trained models available in Hugging Face. The following
`sample notebook <https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_machine_translation/Amazon_JumpStart_Machine_Translation.ipynb>`__
demonstrates how to use the Sagemaker Python SDK for Machine Translation for using these algorithms.

For detailed documentation please refer :ref:`Use Built-in Algorithms with Pre-trained Models in SageMaker Python SDK <built-in-algos>`.
