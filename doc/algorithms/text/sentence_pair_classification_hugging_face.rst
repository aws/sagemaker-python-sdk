Sentence Pair Classification - HuggingFace
############################################

This is a supervised sentence pair classification algorithm which supports fine-tuning of many pre-trained models available in Hugging Face. The following
`sample notebook <https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_sentence_pair_classification/Amazon_JumpStart_Sentence_Pair_Classification.ipynb>`__
demonstrates how to use the Sagemaker Python SDK for Sentence Pair Classification for using these algorithms.

For detailed documentation please refer `Use Built-in Algorithms with Pre-trained Models in SageMaker Python SDK <https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-built-in-algorithms-with-pre-trained-models-in-sagemaker-python-sdk>`__
