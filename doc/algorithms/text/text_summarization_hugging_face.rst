Text Summarization - HuggingFace
############################################

This is a supervised text summarization algorithm which supports many pre-trained models available in Hugging Face. The following
`sample notebook <https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_text_summarization/Amazon_JumpStart_Text_Summarization.ipynb>`__
demonstrates how to use the Sagemaker Python SDK for Text Summarization for using these algorithms.
