`LightGBM <https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ is a popular and efficient open-source implementation of the Gradient Boosting
Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm. GBDT is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to accurately predict a target variable by
combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler and weaker models. LightGBM uses additional techniques to significantly improve
the efficiency and scalability of conventional GBDT.

The following table outlines a variety of sample notebooks that address different use cases of Amazon SageMaker LightGBM algorithm.

For instructions on how to create and access Jupyter notebook instances that you can use to run the example in SageMaker, see
`Use Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html>`__. After you have created a notebook
instance and opened it, choose the SageMaker Examples tab to see a list of all of the SageMaker samples. To open a notebook, choose its
Use tab and choose Create copy.
