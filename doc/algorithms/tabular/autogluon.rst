`AutoGluon-Tabular <https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html>`__ is a popular open-source AutoML framework that trains highly accurate machine learning models on an unprocessed tabular dataset.
Unlike existing AutoML frameworks that primarily focus on model and hyperparameter selection, AutoGluon-Tabular succeeds by ensembling multiple models and stacking them in multiple layers.


The following table outlines a variety of sample notebooks that address different use cases of Amazon SageMaker AutoGluon-Tabular algorithm.

For instructions on how to create and access Jupyter notebook instances that you can use to run the example in SageMaker, see
`Use Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html>`__. After you have created a notebook
instance and opened it, choose the SageMaker Examples tab to see a list of all of the SageMaker samples. To open a notebook, choose its
Use tab and choose Create copy.
