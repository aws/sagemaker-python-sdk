Image Classification - TensorFlow
##################################

This is a supervised image clasification algorithm which supports fine-tuning of many pre-trained models available in Tensorflow Hub. The following
`sample notebook <https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_image_classification/Amazon_JumpStart_Image_Classification.ipynb>`__
demonstrates how to use the Sagemaker Python SDK for Image Classification for using these algorithms.

For detailed documentation please refer :ref:`Use Built-in Algorithms with Pre-trained Models in SageMaker Python SDK <built-in-algos>`
