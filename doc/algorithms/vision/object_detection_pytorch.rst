Object Detection - PyTorch
###########################

This is a supervised object detection algorithm which supports fine-tuning of many pre-trained models available in Pytorch Hub. The following
`sample notebook <https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_object_detection/Amazon_JumpStart_Object_Detection.ipynb>`__
demonstrates how to use the Sagemaker Python SDK for Object Detection for using these algorithms.

For detailed documentation please refer :ref:`Use Built-in Algorithms with Pre-trained Models in SageMaker Python SDK <built-in-algos>`
