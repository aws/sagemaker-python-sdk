Instance Segmentation - MXNet
##############################

This is a supervised image segmentation algorithm which supports  many pre-trained models available in MXNet. The following
`sample notebook <https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_instance_segmentation/Amazon_JumpStart_Instance_Segmentation.ipynb>`__
demonstrates how to use the Sagemaker Python SDK for Image Segmentation for using these algorithms.

For detailed documentation please refer :ref:`Use Built-in Algorithms with Pre-trained Models in SageMaker Python SDK <built-in-algos>`
