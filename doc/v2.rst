Installation
************

.. warning::
    v2 is currently experimental, so proceed with caution. If you do run into issues or have any other feedback,
    please let us know by `opening an issue <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/issues/new/choose>`_
    or `commenting on our planning issue <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/issues/1459>`_.

To install the latest release candidate:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+git@github.com:aws/sagemaker-python-sdk.git@v2.0.0.rc0

To install the latest version of v2:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+git@github.com:aws/sagemaker-python-sdk.git@zwei

If you are executing this pip install command in a notebook, make sure to restart your kernel.

*******************************
Automatically Upgrade Your Code
*******************************

To help make your transition as seamless as possible, v2 of the SageMaker Python SDK comes with a command-line tool to automate updating your code.
It automates as much as possible, but there are still syntactical and stylistic changes that cannot be performed by the script.

.. warning::
    While the tool is intended to be easy to use, we recommend using it as part of a process that includes testing before and after you run the tool.

Usage
=====

Currently, the tool supports only converting one file at a time:

.. code::

    $ sagemaker-upgrade-v2 --in-file input.py --out-file output.py
    $ sagemaker-upgrade-v2 --in-file input.ipynb --out-file output.ipynb

You can apply it to a set of files using a loop:

.. code:: bash

    $ for file in $(find input-dir); do sagemaker-upgrade-v2 --in-file $file --out-file output-dir/$file; done

Limitations
===========

Aliased Imports
---------------

The tool checks for a limited number of patterns when looking for constructors.
For example, if you are using a TensorFlow estimator, only the following invocation styles are handled:

.. code:: python

    TensorFlow()
    sagemaker.tensorflow.TensorFlow()
    sagemaker.tensorflow.estimator.TensorFlow()

If you have aliased an import, e.g. ``from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow as TF``, the tool does not take care of updating its parameters.

TensorFlow Serving
------------------

If you are using the ``sagemaker.tensorflow.serving.Model`` class, the tool does not take care of adding a framework version or changing it to ``sagemaker.tensorflow.TensorFlowModel``.
