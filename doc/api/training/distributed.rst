Distributed Training APIs
-------------------------
SageMaker distributed training libraries offer both data parallel and model parallel training strategies.
They combine software and hardware technologies to improve inter-GPU and inter-node communications.
They extend SageMakerâ€™s training capabilities with built-in options that require only small code changes to your training scripts.
