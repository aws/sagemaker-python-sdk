Orchestrate your SageMaker training and inference jobs with `AWS Step Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html>`__.

You can use the `AWS Step Functions Python SDK <https://aws-step-functions-data-science-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ to easily create workflows that process and publish machine learning models using Amazon SageMaker and AWS Step Functions.
You can create multi-step machine learning workflows in Python that orchestrate AWS infrastructure at scale,
without having to provision and integrate the AWS services separately.

The AWS Step Functions Python SDK uses the SageMaker Python SDK as a dependency.
To get started with step functions, try the workshop or visit the SDK's website:
