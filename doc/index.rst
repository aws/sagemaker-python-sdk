Amazon SageMaker Python SDK
===========================
Amazon SageMaker Python SDK is an open source library for training and deploying machine-learned models on Amazon SageMaker.

With the SDK, you can train and deploy models using popular deep learning frameworks: **Apache MXNet** and **TensorFlow**. You can also train and deploy models with **algorithms provided by Amazon**, these are scalable implementations of core machine learning algorithms that are optimized for SageMaker and GPU training. If you have **your own algorithms** built into SageMaker-compatible Docker containers, you can train and host models using these as well.

Here you'll find API docs for SageMaker Python SDK. The project home-page is in Github: https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk, there you can find the SDK source, installation instructions and a general overview of the library there.
