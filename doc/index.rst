Amazon SageMaker Python SDK
###########################
Amazon SageMaker Python SDK is an open source library for training and deploying machine-learned models on Amazon SageMaker.

With the SDK, you can train and deploy models using popular deep learning frameworks, algorithms provided by Amazon, or your own algorithms built into SageMaker-compatible Docker images.

Here you'll find an overview and API documentation for SageMaker Python SDK. The project homepage is in Github: https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk, where you can find the SDK source and installation instructions for the library.
